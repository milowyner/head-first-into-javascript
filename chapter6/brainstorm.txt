//How do we get the data from the web service to our webpage?

function getData() {
  var data = call some function that gets data from the website;
  updatePage(data);
}


//Once we've got the data, how do we update the page?

function updatePage(data) {
  var div = get element by id;
  div.innerHTML = show data;
}


//What kinds of problems might we have with getting data from a remote server?

There could be issues with the server.
We need an error handler to send a message to the user when we can't retrieve
the data.
